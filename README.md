# YOLO (You Only Look Once) from Scratch using PyTorch

ðŸš€ A clean, minimal YOLO implementation built from scratch using **pure PyTorch**, trained on the **COCO dataset**. No high-level detection libraries used â€” this is all about learning and control.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Custom YOLO architecture (inspired by YOLOv1/YOLOv2)
- Written 100% in PyTorch
- COCO dataset support (train/val)
- Dynamic dataloader with image augmentation
- Custom loss function (bounding box + class confidence)
- Training loop with logging
- Model evaluation (IoU, mAP coming soon)
- Inference pipeline with NMS and visualization
